BANG0D 2.0 - An eRecon mod by PHANT0M.
-------------------------------------
Special Thanks to Rob for the eRecon 1.52 source.
I am not a developer, but the reason I worked on this mod, is because there are no other war bots with the needed features being developed for eMnet.  This bot would NOT be possible without Rob's hard work with eRecon.  This is not a 'rip off'.  I took the base source of a reconnection bot, and added the features needed to make it a proper warbot for today's eMnet servers.
